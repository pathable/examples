# Meteor Examples

## How to Run

1. Change into the UI Framework directory of choice, then run `yarn install`.
2. Build the web app: `yarn start-device`. Keep the meteor app running.
3. Copy the built web app into the native platform: `npx cap sync`.
4. Open the native IDE and run the app: `npx cap open android` or `npx cap open ios`.

> Once you have the android folder generated by capacitor in ./meteor/android, ensure you create `capacitor-cordova-android-plugins/assets` folder to get rid of the first error on build the android project.

> Normally the top-level `android` and `ios` native project folders are committed to source control. They are excluded here to avoid bloating this repository.
